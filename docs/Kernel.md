## Sections

Here lies the steps we were required to complete in order to properly initialise the OS as a 64bit program before launching the kernel procedure.

* [32bit Protected mode to Long Mode](./initialisation/64bit_launching.md)
* [IDT Setup](./initialisation/idt_init.md)
* [Higher Half Setup](./initialisation/higher_half_setup.md)
* [RTC Initialisation](./initialisation/rtc.md)

# Kernel Parts

Here lies functions handled by the kernel itself.

* [RTC](initialisation/rtc.md)
* [Other CPU Functionalities](./initialisation/other_functionalities.md)
* [Bare-Metal Support](kernel/pci.md)
* [Command Prompt](kernel/prompt.md)
